## Inspiration

With vision 2030, the Kingdom aims to facilitate the user's experience and provide effective health services. Our inspiration is that we donâ€™t have international platforms that support all languages worldwide and enable the pilgrims to reach all insurance companies. Also, to address a really important challenge which is the unavailability of medical files belonging to international pilgrims. 

## What it does

It makes the pilgrims life easier by accessing all insurance companies from one platform that will help them to evaluate each service provided by international/local insurance companies and select the most suitable service with taking in consideration the price, quality and type.

Farther more this platform will facilitate the medical provider, that will have the opportunity to access the medical report that was uploaded by the pilgrims during his registration as prerequisite to issue the insurance.


## How we built it

Our product is a mobile application, we build it using ionic framework. We chose it because it can also be a Progressive Web App that can be reached by a larger segment.


## Challenges we ran into

The main challenge is to attract and convince the insurance company to register in this platform. However, one of the things that will help to attract the companies is the fact that there are more than 2 to 4 millions potential customers who normally won't have access to insurance without the platform. 



## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We introduced for the first time one International insurance platform for all pilgrims and visitors that will satisfy all their needs.  Furthermore, we make the process of issuing the insurance document faster than the current traditional way.  Finally, The medical provider can now access the medical files for all pilgrims and visitor to check their health status before any medical treatment. 

## What we learned

We learned a lot in many different aspect, in the soft skills we learned how to work an team and how to transfer the knowledge. In the technical aspect, we learned how to utilize new tools such as ionic platform to satisfy our goal.


## What's next for B-004 Dhamen

From the insurance companies revenue, we can enhance the pilgrim's experience. We will be utilizing the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology to track and monitor the number of pilgrims in every zone in the holy sites. This will have a huge impact in detecting any unexpected cumulative in the number of pilgrims. Finally, we will save the expenditure for the health services to the pilgrims .
